I am tasked with making a random password generator using JavaScript in this assignment.
You will be able to customize how the password will be built. 
Such as password length, uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.
In my opinion, using prompts isn't the easiest way to customize the password, but the assignment calls for the use of prompts.
